# study

These are some materials from my free-time studies.

## Books

A reading list of books that I only partly managed to munch down. It includes authors and works that I am intereseted in, read, but also those that I have not yet gotten to explore.

## GPT Entropy

Snippets of conversations with OpenAI's GPT-3 I found interesting in a discussion with the model around entropy. The language model is a very interseting conversation partner. The factual side sometimes lacks, but I find it immensely useful to expolore concepts, develop directions of thought and find reading material.

## Essay

Short summary of thoughts I've explored over the last years. There's some influence of my chats with GPT, but mainly of books and freely available lectures.

## Note organiser

There is a drawer at my home full of notebooks filled with sparse notes. Some portions have a continuity around a book or lecture series, but they intertwine with different sources, often connecting them. Using any of the available note organising products was not useful to me. Mainly because of the labour intensive process of inter-annotating the notes. I would have to type in all of them manually and then for each single one decide which other ones they relate to. That would require me having all in memory or going through the whole set for every note.

The folder here contains screenshots of a possible self-help in this respect. Inspired by what I write in the essay, I would like a note system that would reflect the aspects of fractality and relativity. Every note (thought) could stand in the center of attention and I would be able to position other notes in the space around it. If all notes were organised this way, I could click through them to change the focal thought and have a feeling of roaming a space.

In addition to the different kinds of arrangement, I would love to connect this system to a language model, such as GPT-3, to be able to quickly pull the notes together into a conversation starter prompt; to be able to discuss any set of ideas quickly.
